## üîí Security & Deploy Playbook

### **Secrets Management**

- Owner-based policies for data isolation
- Public read access only where explicitly needed
- Indexes on frequently queried columns

### **Build & Deploy**
- Single package manager: npm (no bun.lockb)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions (lint, typecheck, build)
- Security audit on every build
- Source maps enabled for debugging

### **Environment Variables (Vercel)**
Required variables to set in Vercel:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### **CORS & Storage**
- Supabase CORS: Restrict to Vercel domains only
- Storage buckets: Private by default
- Public read access only where necessary
